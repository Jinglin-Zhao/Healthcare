Dataset Description
In this competition, youâ€™ll detect the presence and position of catheters and lines on chest x-rays. Use machine learning to train and test your model on 40,000 images to categorize a tube that is poorly placed.

What files do I need?
You will need the train and test images. This is a code-only competition so there is a hidden test set (approximately 4x larger, with ~14k images) as well.
train.csv contains image IDs, binary labels, and patient IDs.
TFRecords are available for both train and test. (They are also available for the hidden test set.)
We've also included train_annotations.csv. These are segmentation annotations for training samples that have them. They are included solely as additional information for competitors.
